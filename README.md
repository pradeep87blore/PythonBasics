Python Basics
---------------

This repo contains some of the notes I have created for myself for learning Python topics. 

Currently, the following are added:

1. Numpy

The intention is to add the following, at the least:

1. Python List, Dictionary, Tuples and Sets
2. Pandas
3. Some plotting library like matplotlib


Datasets:

populationbycountry19802010millions.csv  -> Population of various countries between 1980 and 2010.
