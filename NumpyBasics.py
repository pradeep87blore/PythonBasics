# Numpy provides a homogenous multidimensional array as it's main data type
# It usually is comprised of numbers. This array is indexed by a tuple of positive numbers

# The dimensions are referred to as axes in Numpy

import numpy as np

# Numpy's array is called a ndarray. It is aliased as an array. This is different from the Python's array module array
